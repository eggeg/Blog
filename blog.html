        <p><b>>Assignment One Challenges: 9/27/2022</b><br><br>
        Overall I found the first assignment to be straightforward, the most difficult portion was probably getting the image to show up on the page.
        It took a few minutes to understand that the image file needed to be in the cloned repository on my system. 
        I spent a few hours getting familiar with html using code academy so I was at least somewhat familiar with the requirements of this assignment. My biggest resource
        was probably my chosen search engine (google). I've included a link to the assignment page here. <a href="index.html">Index</a></p>

       <p><b>>Assignment Two Challenges: 10/24/2022</b><br><br>
        The second assignment was more challenging than the first, mostly involving altering html elements with css code the primary challenge came from identifying specific elements
        to change and ensuring that the changes were correct ones. This often required several attempts as the only way to see if an element was changed correctly was to make the change and
        examine the result. While this added some time to the project overall it was, in my opinion, a perfect learning tool for the basics of CSS as it forces you to experiment and get comfortable
        with CSS and html norms.</p>

        <p><b>>Assignment Three Challenges: 10/24/2022</b><br><br>
            The third assignment presented several unique challenges and new web development tools. A few things stood out as more difficult to complete than others. 
            The search filters were very difficult to figure out logically, I ended up creating an array of the posts and if they matched any of the criteria they were removed from the array.
            Whatever was left in the array after all search criteria is checked were the posts to be removed for the search. I also had some difficult figuring out how to interact with the checkbox menus.</p>

            <p><b>>Assignment Four Challenges: 10/24/2022</b><br><br>
               Assignment 4 was an interesting change of pace and presented unique challenges. I did the assignment in roughly two parts.
                The first part being reading the files from the disk to the server that were going to be made available to the client. The second portion was handling the 
                client requests for those files. Overall the assignment was thankfully straightforward and what was lectured in class was directly applicable to the assignment.
                I think the most difficult part of this assignment was probably how unfamiliar the tasks were in general but the lectures were very informative and resources were not difficult to find online.
